This question has plagued me ever since I wanted to get in shape and look good. Is a calorie a calorie? Can I eat whatever I want as long as I don't eat too much?

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Now this question seems dumb. For example if I only ate 2000 calories of sugar every day I'd probably die. The reason i'd probably die is due to lack of vitamins and other essential nutrients my body needs. For example sailors would die of scurvy due to lack of vitamin C ["An estimated two millionÂ ][1]**[sailors died of scurvy][1]**[ between 1500-1800"][1] . [You won't get diabetes from just eating sugar though][2], so that's not an issue. 

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Since sugar is a carbohydrate only it will causes issues with a lack of fat and protein. 

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Lack of protein in your diet can cause many side effects like [weakness or fatigue, viral or bacterial infection, brittle breaking or falling out hair, brittle nails, mood changes and protein cravings][3]. So make sure you get at least[ 56g per day for men][4]. 

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Fat in your diet is responsible for [breaking and transporting fat soluble vitamins][5], so a lack of it is a bad idea. [Fats also insulate our organs and keeps us warm. "Fats also provide our bodies with essential fatty acids which are required to build and maintain our cell membranes, which is important for our skin, hair, eyes, heart, brain and more. Fats also help make certain hormones and help you feel satiated -- to help you feel full."][5] So we need between [44 and 78 grams of fat a day][6] to stay healthy. 

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

But let's assume you're taking supplements, ie you're eating all those essential nutrients separately but you're getting the bulk of your calories from say, processed sugar. To rephrase: Is a calorie a calorie, beyond the essential nutrients your body needs to survive? To answer this question let's propose another question, what would happen to your body on an all sugar diet.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Let's take a hypothetical look at what would happen on an all sugar diet, with added supplements like vitamins and proper amount of protein and fat supplements in the diet. On this diet however you're restricted to 2000 calories of sugar a day or roughly 2.6 cups of sugar. Then minus the 78g (700cal) of fat and 56g(254cal) of protein leaving only 1046 calories for sugar or about 1.35 cups of sugar. Doesn't sound like much at all does it? Go get a cup and a half of sugar sugar and see if you'd be ok with only eating that all day plus vitamins and a protein shake (assuming the shake has the necessary fat you need).

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Initially an all sugar diet would cause a huge surge of dopamine in your brain, making you want more sugar. However in this diet we are being very strict and only allowing that 1.35 cups a day. Now you could space out the sugar throughout the day, only allowing a pinch here and there, but that might be difficult due to the desire for more sugar so try your best to not give into those cravings. Sugar also is very bad at satisfying your hunger, so be prepared to feel hungry all day and crave for sugar. Sugar also helps bacteria to grow in your teeth, so cavities are more likely, definitely brush your teeth more often on this diet too. Not to mention many other side effects of sugar like [depression, aging skin, hurting joints and many more][7].

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Let's forget about those side effects, the real question here is would you lose weight? Could you get fit with this diet? 

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

The answer to the first question is yes. On a calorie deficit, you will lose weight. However because of the satiety index of sugar and it's dopamine spikes you'll be miserably hungry and craving more. After a while however your body might adapt to this diet and not spike as much and might not crave it as much. And by a long time I many many many months to a year.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

The answer to the second question is, maybe. Maybe because of the protein and fat supplementation. 

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

So, the answer to the original question is yes and no. With proper supplementation and willpower, a calorie is a calorie. However because of the needed supplementation one could argue that it isn't. Also, wouldn't it be easier to just eat wholesome meals. With wholesome meals you won't feel hungry or depressed. You might get sugar cravings at first, but they go away after a week or so, trust me i've tried it. You'll feel like you have more energy and feel generally happier and more awake.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Long story short, do whatever you can keep up. Whether that's an all sugar diet with supplementation, but make sure you limit yourself on the calories, or if that's healthy wholesome foods that keep you full all day. The point is, it's not a diet it's a lifestyle and you don't regret doing it day to day.
