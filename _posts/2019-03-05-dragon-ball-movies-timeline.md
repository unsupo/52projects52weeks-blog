## Introduction

<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

After getting tired of waiting for Dragon Ball Super episodes to come out and the tournament of power to begin, I decided to watch Dragon Ball and all the movies. 

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

I was skeptical to watch Dragon Ball (DB). I've watched Dragon Ball Z (DBZ) before and had always thought Dragon Ball was childish. I was wrong. Dragon Ball's power levels are substantially lower and so are the stakes are lower (ie the world or universe isn't at stake). Dragon Ball also has much higher relevance to the Dragon Balls. Every villain in DB wants the dragon balls and that's the main issue each season, well except the Tien Shinhan arc. 

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

DBZ however, only Frieza and previous villains want the dragon balls. DB also has a lot of sexual references which DBZ does not have. 

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

I watched all the DB movies based on their Japanese release date. For instance **Dragon Ball: Curse of the Blood Rubies** was released December 20, 1986 and Dragon Ball episode 43 Bulma's House in Metro West was released in December 17 1986 and episode 44 was December 24th.

## Chronological Order

<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

I watched them in this order:

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->

*   43 -> Dragon Ball: Curse of the Blood Rubies
*   70 -> Dragon Ball: Sleeping Princess in Devil's Castle
*   118 -> Dragon Ball: Mystical Adventure
*   153 -> Dragon Ball: The Path to Power

<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

All the movies seemed to be a retelling of the story, some worse than others. All of them also take 3/4th of the movie before it actually reaches the main issue then quickly finishes the climax since most movies were short 30-40 minutes. Most of the movies dubbed, had Goku and a few other voices drastically changed. Maybe the english dub happened too long past the series and they couldn't get the same voice actors.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Some of the movies are a "what if", meaning they don't match the main story, but are a spinoff. I've tried to outline the what if in as few changes to allow it to make sense in the main series, but none of the movies could exist as part of the main series.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->

## Dragon Ball: Curse of the Blood Rubies

<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

This is the first movie in the Dragon Ball series. Chronologically speaking it takes place after episode 43, Bulma's House in Metro West. This movie retells the story so far up to episode 13, so that's probably best as to when to watch this movie.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

The movie reintroduces all the main characters up to this point. "What if" blood rubies exist? Is the main plot of this movie. Assuming blood rubies don't exist in the main story, or assuming blood rubies don't hold the same power, or this king never found them in the main story. Anyways, because of this Goku's dragon ball is stolen by a blood ruby influenced king looking to cure his desire for blood rubies.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

As an homage to the original story it ends similarly to the first wish but with more of an impact in the inconsequential wish. For instance, the first time around Bulma wants a boyfriend as her wish and Yamcha wants to not be shy around women, and just like the original story, the journey fulfilled both their wishes without the dragon balls. However in the origin Oolong wishes for panties and this one wishes for the King's land to go back to how it was before blood rubies, but Bulma and Yamcha are the same.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->

## Dragon Ball: Sleeping Princess in Devil's Castle

<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

This movie takes place after the first wish in the main series as well as Goku's great ape transformation. Because of this, this movie takes place after episode 16 in the main series. However chronologically it takes place after episode 70 **"Attack! We Five Fighters".**

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

This is a "what if" Master Roshi wanted the Sleeping Princess specifically instead of any girl he asked Goku and Krillin to get initially.  The stories continues as before with launch ending up being the sleeping princess in Roshi’s eyes.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

This movie has a different opening sequence and song unlike the previous movie. The voices for some characters have changed. Most noticeably Goku and Bulma, almost to an annoying degree. This voice change will carry over to subsequent movies as well.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->

## Dragon Ball: Mystical Adventure

<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

This is a complete spinoff from the main series, which only shares similar characters, but not story. It does however show some characters from later in the series, like Crane Hermit. Because of this, this is best after episode 84, but chronologically it comes after episode 118 **"Tenshinhan's Determination" .**

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

This movie plucks various characters from the series, namely Sergeant Metallic, Upa, Master Shen, and many others and puts them in this weird world. This world where Chiaotzu is an emperor who hosts a martial arts tournament. His wife is missing so he wants the dragon balls to find her, but his advisors are not looking out for his best interest.

### Dragon Ball: The Path to Power

<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

The last dragon ball movie which once again is a retelling of the dragon ball story. This time in beautiful GT artwork, Goku looks like his child self from GT. However this story eliminates all the growth and character development the story did so well to tell and instead, Goku is very strong without any prior training. Goku never meets Krillin or trains with master Roshi, Goku never turns great ape either. 

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

In this movie, android 8 is the star. Android 8 is met under control of red ribbon, but quickly snaps free. Then later in the movie when general black tries to retain control by boarding a huge robot to take on Goku, Android 8 comes to the rescue and defeats Black. The first wish is used to revive android 8. I was hoping all along that Goku would turn super saiyan, there were so many moments i thought he would, but he doesn't.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Seeing how this is a retelling up to the defeat of the red ribbon army, this movie is best after episode 67. However chronologically it is after 153, the end of dragon ball.
