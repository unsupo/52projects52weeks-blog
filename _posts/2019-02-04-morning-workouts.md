Working out has been mostly a roller coaster ride for me.  A couple years ago I did really well with making sure i ate healthy foods and went to the gym everyday.  However a lot has changed since then, I got married, had a child, bought a house. Needless to say, it got more and more difficult to workout.

## My Schedule

<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

My schedule usually consists of me waking up at 8am and getting to work by 9am.  Then I can typically leave work by 5pm. If i head to the gym next, I’ll get there by 5:30pm then working out for an hour gets me home by 6:30pm.  I then eat dinner with the family then my baby son starts going to bed by 7pm, however sometimes 6:30pm depending on how he’s feeling. This leaves me with anywhere from no time, to maybe 30 minutes to spend with my son before he goes to bed.  Also, on those days i have to stay later at work, there is no chance to spend time with him.

## The Solution

<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

The solution was simple, wake up earlier in the mornings to go to the gym.  Now, i’ve tried waking up for the gym before and I’ll tell you, I suck at it.  I am probably one of the worst waker upers on the planet. Waking up in the morning is extremely tough for me, thankfully I have my wonderful wife to help. The first little while it took me about 45 minutes to get up. I would have an internal conflict, part of my body wanting to go back to sleep, the other wanting to wake up. Until finally the side that wanted to get up won and i slunk out of bed, when it’s still dark out i might add and get ready for the gym.

I usually do my own kind of bro splits, or in other words, Mondays and Thursdays are push days, Tuesdays and Fridays are pull days with Wednesdays being let days.  I have always struggled with convincing myself to do Wednesday leg days. 

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

I know what you're going to say, "Just wake up. It's not that hard, i wake up at <insert absurdly early time here>". Some wake up a lot earlier for work for instance, but for me it's not that simple. It's easier to wake up when you have to wake up, not as easy when you just want to wake up for something. 

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

I've tried all kinds of solutions in the past for waking up. I've tried setting up multiple alarms, i've tried putting many different alarms throughout the house to force me to get out of bed, i've tried gradually waking up by starting 15 minutes earlier than my normal waking up time. Unfortunately none of these work. 

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

When i set multiple alarms or many alarms throughout the house, i'd simple turn them all off and climb back in bed, plus many alarms throughout the house would be annoying for my wife and wake up my baby. 

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

When it comes to gradually waking up earlier and earlier, that doesn't work because I'll be frustrated that i woke up earlier without any real reason because i can't do anything 15 minutes earlier. I'll just fall back asleep and feel like i got less sleep for no reason.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

I've never had issue with going to the gym because i've regretted it or anything. My issue is with waking up in general, I love being at the gym. When I finally do get out of bed I do say "Aw hell yeah, i get to go to the gym" and when I sleep in or feel sick or can't go to the gym I regret it and wish I could have gone.

## Day 1

<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

So, day one, i woke up an hour earlier, 7 am.  This was horrible, I would drift in and out of sleep trying to convince myself to wake up.  Dramatic I know, but like i said, i’m not a morning person. I finally woke up, made my protein shake (yes i started the new habit of drinking a protein shake in the morning now too) and caffeine drink and ran out the door.  On my way to the gym i started to get stomach issues, great another hurdle, so when i got to the gym i rushed to the bathroom.   


<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Now I only had less than 30 minutes to do my at least an hour workout.  Ugh, I learned I needed to wake up earlier the next day. I got in my first pec exercise, a lower bench press, then moved on to a shoulder workout.  I got about halfway through my shoulder workout to realize i needed to leave in order to make it to work on time. I asked my wife to wake me up at 6:30am.

## Day 2

<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Day 2 was somehow harder to wake up than Day 1.  But, I managed to do it in record time, instead of 45 minutes to wake up I only needed 30 minutes.  I then rushed to leave the house, but noticed my dog had gotten sick in his kennel, shouldn’t have feed him table scraps from the omelettes the night before…  I then left to the gym and completed my cycle of bicep curls: drag curls, concentration curls, and barbell curls. As well as my lat pull downs, rows and trap exercise.  I felt accomplished for completing my full workout, minus the quick 10 minute jog i wanted to do after each workout. However I felt like a zombie at work that day. Did i forget to mention I have a horrible habit of getting to bed by 1 or 2 am every night?  This would need to get fixed as well.

## Day 3

<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Day 3 I skipped the morning workout to recover (was the excuse i told myself).  This was supposed to be leg day, but i usually skipped leg day anyways (another excuse, I’m getting good at telling myself excuses).  Oh and another really good excuse, I’ll do it next week.   


<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->

## Day 4

<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Day 4 I woke up again at 6:30am, but revenge of the stomach pain hit again.  This time it lasted all day. I got my workout done, but i didn’t put a lot into the workout due to the stomach pain.  I once again felt dead at work.  


<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->

## Day 5

<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Day 5 I skipped my workout again, I convinced myself I couldn’t be a zombie 3 out of 5 days at work this week so opted to keep it at 2 out of 5.  


<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->

## Conclusion

<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Unfortunately even the best made plans can be stopped by life, life just has a habit or messing things up. All in all, waking up and doing my workout is very difficult for me.  First I’m terrible at waking up so it takes me a very long time to finally get out of bed.  Secondly I seem to have more frequent stomach issues when i wake up early in the morning. Thirdly, I also don’t feel like i push myself as hard early in the morning.  And finally, I’m not acclimated to waking up early, so it’s very difficult to start. This leads me to feeling very tired throughout the day, causing me to be unmotivated to do it again the next day.

## Future

<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

I will continue to try and wake up early in the morning. This may be tough, but I feel this method of jumping in the deep end and trying to swim will get easier over time. Eventually I might even become a morning person and my body will simply get up without even the need for an alarm.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

This is the first of a multipart post which will include me trying to get back in the routine of exercising and eating healthy.  Future posts, i’ll examine the best strategy for growing muscle size (hypertrophy) and keeping up with a healthy diet. I’ll then create an app to automate that whole process for me and help me stay on track.  


<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

The next post I’ll go over how week 2 went as well as what i’ve learned about for the most efficient way to gain muscle mass and hopefully achieve my lifelong goal of gaining a six pack!!!
