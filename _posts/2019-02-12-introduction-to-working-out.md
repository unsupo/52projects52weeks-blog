<!-- wp:paragraph -->

This is an introduction to working out and there are three main goals when working out. 

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->

*   First is to train for endurance, the goal here is to be able to perform an activity for a long period of time.  
*   Next is strength, this is simply using your muscles to generate as much force as they can in a short interval.  
*   Finally is to train for size, where the goal here is to get your muscles to look as big as physically possible.

<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Depending on your overall goal you may want to mix up these 3 in different aspects.  Just keep in mind, your body is an efficiency machine. It will strive to make it’s life as easy it possibly can.  Your body doesn’t want to use good form for instance because it’s much easier not to, it’s that simple.

### Types of Muscle Activation

<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

There are three different types of muscle activations that can occur.  

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->

*   Concentric 
*   Isometric
*   Eccentric.

<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

To explain these 3 types it helps to use a workout as an example, I’ll use the bench press.  


<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

The concentric part of the bench press is you pushing the bar from your chest to the peak of the exercise. It’s the pushing action.  You can concentrically push it half way or a quarter of the way because once again concentric is the push of the exercise.  


<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

The isometric part is you holding the bar still at any point in the exercise or in this example, holding it still at the peak of the exercise.  


<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

The eccentric part is you resisting gravity as you let the weight fall back from the peak to your chest.  


<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Each have their advantages, for example, concentric helps with the explosive part of the movement.  Isometrics have been shown to help build strength and eccentric helps with tearing down muscle fibers which helps in size.  


<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

### Definitions

<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

A few definitions are required to move forward from here.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Weightlifting exercises typically consist of reps and sets.  


<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Reps are the number of successive movements performed.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Sets are blocks of reps consisting of some amount of break between sets.  


<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Volume is the total amount of reps you do in a workout.  


<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

For example if I have an exercise that requires 3 sets of 8 (reps) with a pause of 1 minute.  This means I perform 8 unrested successive movements of that exercise, break for a minute, then do it again, pause for a minute, then do it one last time.  Which resulted in a volume of 3*8=24.

### Exercise Formula

<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Exercising can be broken down to a straight forward formula with your current level and your goal adjusting the quantity of each ingredient.  


<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Examples for each step will be explained below.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list {"ordered":true} -->

1.  Get your current baseline.
2.  Get your final goal.
3.  Take the difference between your goal and baseline to create realistic milestones.
4.  Establish a routine.
5.  Chart your progress
6.  Compare yourself against your milestones every now and then
7.  Ramp up your routine periodically and add variety to your routine. 

<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->

### Endurance

<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

A good example of an endurance athlete is a marathon runner.  To get to this point, you’d need to first assess your current abilities.  If you can barely walk to your mailbox, maybe you start by doing that multiple times in a day.  Maybe once in the morning and once at night. With your milestone being to make it to twice that distance.  Then after a week you try to make it twice the distance and if you can then up the distance and so on. At some point you’ll want to work on distance, so maybe throw in make it a certain distance in under a certain time.  And you keep up this progression.  


<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

The goal with endurance is to increase endurance, so you must simply push yourself to go farther and faster every time.  There are more advanced techniques, but that’s beyond the scope of this article.  


<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->

### Strength

<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

A good example of strength is a powerlifter.  A powerlifter must lift a very heavy weight in a particular exercise, a heavier weight than anyone else in the competition, once.  The key here is they only need to lift the weight once for it to count. This is the basis for strength workouts. Lift as heavy as you can once, then take a break to fully recover and do it again.  Strength athletes focus on form in a different way to bodybuilders. Strength athletes want to use a form that incorporates as many muscles as possible to make them as strong as possible for that one lift.  


<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

The training here is straight forward, just lift as heavy as you can.  Measure that value and the next time in the gym try to lift even heavier and so on.    


<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

It has been shown that isometrics helps in strength gains, so this may be a more advanced way to gain strength quickly.  In other words, simple try to move an immovable object, it helps to do this at each point in the exercise as well. For instance if you had an adjustable height bench press, put the bar at different heights and load the bar with hundreds of points (or more if you can bench that) and just push against it.  The point here is to push against it with all your might, tell yourself you can move it. Then move it to a different height and do it again.  


<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->

### Size

<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Size, bulk, whatever you call it, this is bodybuilding.  Striving to get your muscles to look as big as possible or in some case just bigger to meet a size goal.  This is what movie stars and models use to look sexy. Obviously there a third component not part of the workout, which is your diet, but that won’t be covered here.  


<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

With endurance focusing on high reps, strength on low, this is the middle ground.  Unlike strength and endurance though, with size you want to be inefficient. This means you don’t want to have other muscle groups help lift a weight.  You want the muscles your working on to grow in size, thus you want only the muscles you want to grow to be contracting.  


<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Typically, strength athletes don’t have model physiques.  This is because they typically don’t watch their diets like models and bodybuilders do.  They also don’t try to get a well rounded physique, so they’ll only focus on some muscles and not on the ones that a bodybuilder might think is smaller or disproportionate from what it should look like.  Endurance athletes will typically have low body fat percentage, but not as much size because that would slow them down and require energy to those muscles when not needed.

### The Three Pillars of Building Muscles 

<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

There are 3 ways to build muscle.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->

*   Eccentric overload
*   Metabolic stress
*   Progressive overload

<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Progressive overload is simple increase the size or volume of an exercise as often as you can.  I strive to increase the weight i can lift every time i go to the gym, but eventually there will be a limit.  For example you don’t see dudes bench pressing 10,000 lbs, so what do these guys do to get bigger? They simply increase the volume, either add another set or add another rep to a workout.  


<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Eccentric overload is where focus on time under tension.  This means you spend more time in the eccentric part of the workout.    


<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Lastly is metabolic stress.  This is simply put train beyond failure.  Do an exercise until you can’t anymore, then lower the weights and keep doing the exercise.  This is the hardest because you have to mentally and physically push past your limits. This can help reduce time in the gym and reduce the amount of volume on a particular workout which can help reduce joint damage.  


<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

The typical way to perform all workouts should be, explosively push up as fast as you can.  Then flex the muscle you’re targeting while holding it in position. Finally let it down slowly resisting the force of gravity the whole way down.  Then repeat.

### Future

<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

I plan to use this article as a building point for an exercise app.  I will utilize everything i’ve learned about how best to workout and how to build programs to meet individual needs.  This app will focus on randomizing workouts while still focusing on the three pillars mentioned above.
