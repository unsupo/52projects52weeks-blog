Early last year, my great-great-grandfather's old Washburn acoustic guitar made its way into my possession. It was a guitar I always loved when I was a kid, but it never sounded great. So when it came into my hands, I decided to replace its old, worn out strings - guitars are meant to be played, after all.

Simple as it may have been, this was a fun project for me to take on, as a love for music has always run deep in my family. But first, before we get into the how-to, a little history.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->

## History

<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

The modern guitar developed over the course of 4,000 years. It was first thought to have evolved from the lute in 16th-century Spain, but in the 1960s, it was determined that though related to the guitar, as they share common ancestors, the lute actually had no direct influence on the development of the modern guitar. Rather, the evolution of the guitar goes back much further.

So let's go far back to the earliest known stringed instrument, the bowl harp, which was originally made from a tortoise shell and a simple bent stick, and was played in ancient Sumeria, Mesopotamia, and Egypt. Another instrument called the tanbur, which developed from the bowl harp, featured a flatter, straighter neck to allow for a wider range of musical notes. Ancient Egyptian musicians played bowl harps, tanburs, and other instruments in musical ensembles (one Egyptian singer in particular, named Har-Mose, possessed what is now the oldest surviving guitar-like instrument in the world; it can be seen at the Museum of Egyptian Antiquities in Cairo).

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

These simple, often three-string instruments developed further, branching off into several directions and creating numerous instruments, including the lute, until the four-course (four pairs of strings each tuned in unison with each other) guitar became all the rage in Europe during the Renaissance. A fifth pair of strings was later added, gradually replacing the four-course instrument until it became dominant.

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

A sixth course of strings was added in 17th-century Italy, later turning into six single strings, meaning that, interestingly, the six-string guitar was developed from the twelve-string - and the instrument modern musicians are now used to began to truly take shape. Then, in 1850, Spanish luthier Antonio de Torres Jurado improved the guitar's tone by increasing the size of the instrument's body and lengthening its neck. This became the standard for the instrument, going for the most part unchanged to this day.

Later, the electric guitar came into being when pickups were added, though they weren't very successful until 1936, when the guitar manufacturing company Gibson introduced a brand new model called the ES-150. The American jazz and swing musician <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Charlie Christian (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ce9Jtl9D6FQ" target="_blank">Charlie Christian</a>, an important pioneer of bebop music, popularized it, though he was far from the first to use one.

And now! With all that out of the way, let's get onto what we came here for:

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->

## Let's restring this thing.

First, here's the guitar in question. It's incredibly old, and it shows, but I think all those scratches and dents and faded areas add to its character. I really love this guitar, and I can't wait to learn some old Johnny Cash and Hank Williams songs on this sucker when I get one of the tuning pegs fixed!

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Here's how to restring it. First, choose your strings. I just decided to wing it here, having no knowledge of what kinds of strings are best for this type of guitar. You can get steel strings, which are the standard for a regular acoustic guitar, or nylon strings, which are used on Spanish/classical guitars. The pack of Ernie Ball strings I bought had three steel strings and three nylon strings, which should make for a really pretty sound. I got them from Guitar Center for about $10.

Now it's time to remove the old strings. Every guitar is a little different, but it starts the same: turn each of the tuning pegs counterclockwise until the strings are loose enough for you to pull them through the holes in each peg. Easy peasy. Now we need to go down to the hole in the body of the guitar, where the strings attach to the body. Again, this Washburn is older than your mom so it took some doing, but taking a look at how the strings are connected to your guitar is simple enough. But for me, this part sucked. I had to use pliers to get the damn things out. Depending on the make and model of your instrument, you may need a screwdriver - just be very careful not to scratch or break it.

Once you have the strings out, open your new pack and sort them by size. The largest string goes on top, smallest on the bottom. Place them into where the old ones were by the hole in the body, and run them up the neck to the headstock (that's the end of the neck where the tuning pegs live). Make sure that the strings fit into these notches at the top of the neck, or else you'll have them hanging out all loosey goosey all over the fretboard.

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Now you just slide the strings into the holes in the tuning pegs, and tighten tighten tighten until they're tense! Do a couple strums because it's fun, and then it's time to tune it. This part is easy, since there are several websites and apps that can help you do this (I used [this one][1]). Just follow the instructions, click on each of the strings in the app/site, and tune your guitar accordingly until the notes match. This can be a little more difficult than it sounds, but it's not too bad. Note that there are several different tunings you can use, but the standard goes: low E, A, D, G, B, and high E, from lowest to highest.

Unfortunately, as I said, one of the tuning pegs on my Washburn is broken, so I'll need to get that fixed before I can play it properly. But until then, enjoy this picture of what the inside of a guitar looks like, as well as another of the original warranty sticker. Pretty cool right?
